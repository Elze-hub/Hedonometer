## 1.3 
Choose 2–3 sanity checks and explain what they tell you about data quality.

I consider "making sense" as a visible contrast between the most positive and most negative words. These make sense to me as the most positive section have words that indicate happiness: laughter, love, joy, excellent, and the negative words have dark words: suicide, murder, cancer, death. There are no contrasts against each other in the positive word list and the same goes for the negative word list. 

# 2
## 2.1
Interpret the histogram in words. Is the distribution centered? skewed? clustered?

Identify 1 pattern you did not expect.

## 2.2
Pick 5 of the “most disagreed-about” words and discuss why they might be
contested:

– ambiguity / multiple meanings
– cultural references
– slang and time period
– irony, profanity, or taboo

• Connect your qualitative interpretation to the quantitative pattern.

## 2.3
Interpret what your plot suggests about the four corpora.

Give one concrete example of a word that is “common” in one corpus but missing in
another, and interpret why that might be

# 3

Write an interpretative paragraph addressing things like:

• What meanings/contexts the words can have

• Why an happiness score might be high/low

• What kinds of voices or communities might use it differently


Your goal is not to be “right,” but to show careful interpretive reasoning.

# 4 

## 4.1
In your own words, reconstruct the dataset’s generation pipeline as a sequence of steps.

(You can present this as a numbered list, diagram, or short narrative.)

## 4.2 
Discuss at least five consequences of the dataset’s design choices. For each consequence,
include:


• The choice (what did they do?)

• The consequence (what does this make easier/harder to see?)

• A concrete example from your exploration (a word, a plot pattern, or a missingness pattern)

## 4.3
Write a short “instrument note” (200–400 words):

• What would you trust this dataset to measure well?

• What would you refuse to claim based on it?

• What improvements would you make if you rebuilt it?
